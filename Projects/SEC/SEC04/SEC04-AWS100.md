## Tips
* User [Google Authenticator ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) for MFA.
* Do not ever commit, add or push any of your access and secret keys to source control systems like git, or any other publicly accessible platform where others can access it. If you accidentaly have done so, make sure to delete the access and secret keys immediately in your console and generate new ones.
