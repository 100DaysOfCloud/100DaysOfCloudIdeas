## Tips
* Managed policies are created and maintained by AWS. A managed policy has a small, orange box on the left side of the policy's name.
* Use the [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) app for MFA.
* Do not ever commit, add or push any of your access and secret keys to source control systems like git. You must also never share or make your access keys public in any way shape or form. If you accidentaly have done so, make sure to delete the access and secret keys immediately in your console and generate new ones.
* By default, IAM users are not allowed access to the Billing console. It has to be enabled seperately by using the root user under "My Account".
