# COM04-AWS400 - Create a cluster of virtual machines using docker swarm

## Cloud Service Provider

- Amazon Web Services

## Difficulty

- Level 400 (Expert)

## Project's Author(s)

## Objectives

### You need to complete the following:

- Create an EC2 Instance with user data script to install Docker
- Setup that EC2 Instance as a manager node
- Create multiple instances (2 to 3) with user data script to create worker nodes and join them with manager node
- Start any service like nginx to test our Swarm Cluster
- Scale that service to multiple nodes
- Delete all the resources you created after completion

### You need to answer the following:

- How to check status of Docker nodes ?
- What behaviour is expected if one of the worker or manager nodes went down ?
- How to get state of all the containers running on different nodes ?
- How to get token to add more workers and managers ?

## Costs

- Included in the Free Tier
- \$1-2 per hour running

## Estimated time to complete

- 4-5 hours

## Tips

- Use t2.micro instances for creating nodes to avoid unexpected charges.
- To add more manager or worker nodes, it is not required to SSH into the new instance. Utilize the "user data" functionality.
- Only allow incoming SSH traffic in security groups for the instances that require it.
