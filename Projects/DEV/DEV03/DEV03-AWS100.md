## Objectives

###  You need to complete the following:

* Create an IAM user with a programmatic access type (and Administrator Access) if you do not have one already
* Install AWS CLI 
* Configure AWS credentials locally: `aws configure` 
* Create an S3 bucket: `aws s3 mb s3://<unique-bucket-name>`
* Check the bucket was created: `aws s3 ls`
* Delete the bucket when you are done: `aws s3 rb s3://<unique-bucket-name>`

###  You need to answer the following: 

* How are permissions granted to IAM users?
* What credentials are created when configuring AWS locally and where are they stored? 
* What is the difference between `s3` and `s3api` Commands?

## Tips
  - IAM users with programmatic access are given an *access key id* and *secret access key*. After creating a user a *Download.csv* file is generated that contains these values. Download and save the file to access them for setting up AWS locally.
